# Releasing Sample Repository

This project uses the GitHub release feature to release your code using Semantic Versioning.

# Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Example: Python 3.8.10

where 3 is Major version number,
      8 is Minor version number, 
      10 is patch version number.
